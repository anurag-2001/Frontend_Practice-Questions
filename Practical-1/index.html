     <p>Dear <b>Jason</b>,</p>

     <p>I’m writing to resign from my position as customer service representative,<br/> effective JUNE 30,2021.

        I’ve recently decided to go back to school,<br/> and my program starts in early September. <br/><br/>
        I’m tendering my resignation now so that I can be as helpful as possible <br/>to you during the transition.

        I’ve truly enjoyed my time working with you </br> and everyone else on our team at LMK. 
        It’s rare to find a customer service role <br/>that offers as much opportunity to grow andlearn, 
        as well as such a positive,<br/> inspiring team of people to grow and learn with.<br/><br/>

        I’m particularly grateful for your guidance while I was considering furthering my education.<br/> Your support has meant so much to me. 

<br/><br/>Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help you find and train my replacement.

<br/><br/>Thanks, and best wishes,</p>
<p>Anurag Sharma</p>
